KatieQuest! The First Person Dungeon Crawling RPG/Visual Novel.

Engine: Godot 4.2.2

Will have Dungeon Crawling (etrian oddysey, Persona Q styled), with an overworld to explore (like Shin Megami Tensei) and visual novel fun times like any other visual novel!
Also will include Persona 3 portable styled sub area exploration too.

Main Character will be Katie Starlight with her spirits Suzie and Minra Starlight to help in combat!
